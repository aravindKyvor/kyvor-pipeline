                    1.EGFR (HER1), epidermal growth factor receptor, is a
                    tyrosine kinase receptor, which activates RAS/RAF/MEK and
                    PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, leading to increased cell
                    proliferation and growth (PMID: 24312144). EGFR activating
                    mutations, amplification, and overexpression are found in a
                    variety of tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer
                    (PMID: 26609494, PMID: 30284706) and colorectal cancer
                    (PMID: 30243897), and the EGFRvIII variant is commonly found
                    in glioblastoma (PMID: 30201736).

                    2.Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently
                    overexpressed in TNBC and is emerging as a therapeutic
                    target. EGFR gene amplification, one of the mechanisms of
                    EGFR overexpression, is highly variable and found in up to
                    24% of triple-negative breast cancer (PMID: 24406864). Copy
                    number increase of EGFR is a suitable biomarker for
                    Cetuximab therapy (PMID: 29449271).

                    leading to reduced tumor growth (PMID: 22477724). Lapatinib
                    is FDA approved for ERBB2 (HER2)-positive (overexpressing)
                    breast cancer (FDA.gov).

                    1.AKT3, AKT serine/threonine kinase 3, is a serine-threonine
                    protein kinase, which regulates cell proliferation and
                    survival through PI3K signaling (PMID: 18955974). AKT3
                    mutations have been identified in melanoma (PMID: 18813315),
                    altered expression has been observed in breast cancer (PMID:
                    31320990), and Akt3 is downregulated by several micro-RNAs
                    to inhibit cell migration and invasion (PMID: 31383783,
                    PMID: 31160577, PMID: 31074018, PMID: 30825222).

                    2.AKT3 is the most frequently amplified AKT isoform in
                    breast cancer, and has been mostly studied in the
                    triple-negative subtype in the context of resistance to
                    therapy . Downregulation of Akt3 significantly inhibits the
                    growth of TNBC lines in three-dimensional (3D) spheroid
                    cultures and in mouse xenograft models, whereas loss of Akt1
                    or Akt2 have more modest effects. These results imply that
                    Akt3 has a specific function in TNBCs; thus, its therapeutic
                    targeting may provide a new treatment option for this tumor
                    subtype (PMID: 24335962). AKT3 has a putative oncogenic
                    function and is the most frequently altered, mainly by means
                    of copy number gain (PMID: 26645663).

                    3.Akt activation is a convergent feature of acquired EGFR
                    tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, across a spectrum of
                    diverse, established upstream resistance mechanisms.
                    Combined treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
                    and Akt inhibitor causes apoptosis and synergistic growth
                    inhibition in multiple EGFR tyrosine kinase
                    inhibitor-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer models (PMID:

                    leading to decreased mTORC1 signaling and potentially
                    resulting in decreased tumor cell growth (PMID: 17766661,
                    PMID: 28400999). Afinitor (everolimus) is FDA approved in
                    combination with Aromasin (exemestane) in hormone

                    5.The mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibitor is not yet
                    dissected. MKâ€‘2206, an AKT inhibitor, and a group of
                    mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors were found
                    to exert synergistic lethal effects in combination with
                    Gefitinib in preclinical studies. Targeting the mTOR complex
                    1 (mTORC1) pathway may be a potential strategy for the
                    treatment of EGFR-resistant TNBC (PMID: 29344641). Clinical
                    studies have shown the sensitivity of mTOR inhibitors to
                    AKT3 amplification (Journal of Clinical Oncology 2015
                    33:15_suppl, 530-530, PMID: 28961834).

                    1.ACCND3, cyclin D3, encodes for the D3-type cyclin protein,
                    which regulates CDK kinases in order to promote transition
                    of G1 to S phase during cell cycle progression (PMID:
                    23079656). Amplification and/or overexpression of CCND3 have
                    been linked to B-cell lymphomas (PMID: 16402392, PMID:
                    16322284, PMID: 32059783) and has been associated with a
                    worse prognosis in breast and bladder cancers (PMID:
                    30950241), and mutations have been observed in
                    MLL-rearranged AML (PMID: 30381403).

                    cancer cell lines harboring CCND3 amplification demonstrated
                    sensitivity to treatment with Abemaciclib (LY2835219) in
                    culture and in vivo, resulting in increased apoptosis,

                    through KDR (VEGFR2) on endothelial cells (PMID: 32001672).
                    Vegfa may stimulate tumor angiogenesis in several tumor
